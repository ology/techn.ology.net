Ever been to the park and heard a tribe drumming in the distance?  This is a [drum circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_circle).
Upon closer inspection, each drummer has a single instrument (or maybe a set of bongos).
Each drummer keeps a steady beat in common and in syncopation with his or her fellow drummers.

I wondered if this could be simulated somehow?  There are of course decisions to be made - parts to this equation... How should the drummers enter? All at once or gradually?  How should a drum be chosen or selected?  And what phrase(s) should be played anyway?
