After years of fiddling with algorithmic composition, I have come to reach for certain tools to craft melodies, bass-lines, solos, etc.  My latest generative composition program and output will illustrate...

~

The program in question is [quasi-random-durations](https://github.com/ology/Music/blob/master/quasi-random-durations)

The code libraries that I love to use so much are:

- [Data::Dumper::Compact](https://metacpan.org/release/Data-Dumper-Compact) - For concisely displaying the data structures that embody programmed musical things.
- [MIDI::Drummer::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/release/MIDI-Drummer-Tiny) - For adding beats to my projects.
- [Music::Duration::Partition](https://metacpan.org/release/Music-Duration-Partition) - For generating quasi-random rhythmic phrases in a given duration.
- [Music::Scales](https://metacpan.org/release/Music-Scales) - For providing the scale notes that are the atoms of music.
- [Music::VoiceGen](https://metacpan.org/release/Music-VoiceGen) - For generating a smooth series of pitches.

(A couple are written by me, because they didn't exist yet!)

Here is the output of [the program](https://github.com/ology/Music/blob/master/quasi-random-durations) imported into my [DAW](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/), tweaked and enhanced.  The keyboards and bass were generated by selecting the "better" bits after many runs.  Also: it is an an odd time signature: 5/4, then 3/4, then 5/4 again.
