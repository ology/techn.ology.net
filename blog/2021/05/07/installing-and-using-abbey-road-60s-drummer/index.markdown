I had trouble installing and using [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/) "[Abbey Road 60s Drummer](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/drums/abbey-road-vintage-drummer/)" program.  But after significant trial, error, and finally talking to NI support, this is the proper way to get it happening:

In short, you need to first install the Native Instrument program [Kontakt 6 Player](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-6-player/) *with* the program [Native Access](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/native-access/).  **Then** download and install the drummer app with it.

After that, running the Kontakt 6 Player will list the drummers, etc. in its library.  Installing will also make the [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Units) and [VST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) plugins available for your [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation).

Whew.  Simple in the end, but painful for a while there. ;)
