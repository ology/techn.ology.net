Recently I was inspired by the Brian Eno section of [this generative music presentation](https://teropa.info/loop/#/airports) (right arrow or space-bar moves ahead in the presentation), which describes Eno's tape-loop setup.

So I tasked myself with attempting to simulate these simultaneous tape-loops.Â  Naturally I made the cleverly named program, [tape-loop](https://github.com/ology/Music/blob/master/tape-loop) for this.

Here is one run, turned into an MP3 file:

[tape-loop-04.mp3](tape-loop-04.mp3)

Ok. Here is another run:

[tape-loop-05.mp3](tape-loop-05.mp3)

And here is a long one, with a warm synth pad:

[tape-loop-06.mp3](tape-loop-06.mp3)

For the chromatic piano fans, here is one at 300 BPM with all the notes between C5 and C6:

[tape-loop-09.mp3](tape-loop-09.mp3)
