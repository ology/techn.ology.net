Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut
at the foot of a mountain.

---

One evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there was nothing to steal.

Ryokan returned and caught him. "You have come a long way to visit me," he told the prowler, "and you should not return empty-handed. Please take my clothes as a gift."

The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away.

Ryoken sat naked, watching the moon. "Poor fellow," he mused, "I wish I could have given him this beautiful moon."

What does this mean?  Being a Zen anecdote, does "meaning" even apply?  Literal meanings may not be the point.  Anyway, the Human Condition is to look for reasons, and I am curious...

First, what is the motivation of the thief?  I think that he or she is "just a thief", i.e. a trope playing the part of a one dimensional character.

Who is Ryoken?  [Well...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkan)  Why he unperturbed by encountering a thief in his home?  Well, he is a Zen master, after all.  But why does he give away his clothes?  And why does he wish he could give away the Moon, too?

Hmmmmm...
