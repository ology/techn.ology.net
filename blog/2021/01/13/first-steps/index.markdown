Today I decided to hunt down the first "computer" I ever had...

---

At first I thought it was a Texas Instruments [programmable calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_calculator).  But after much searching I came up empty-handed.  Then I thought hard, "What else could it have been?"  On a whim, I looked up Tandy programmable calculators from the 80s.  And lo!  There it was, the [Tandy PC-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_Pocket_Computer) on a wikipedia page.  Whew.  Mission accomplished.

Here is a video tear-down of the thing:
