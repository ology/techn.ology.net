I stumbled across [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-april-10-2019.html) with this cool chart.

---

Naturally I wondered if I could replicate this and analyze my own music, as my latest release, ["X"](https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/9e074913-54f9-4c36-9e6e-5e005ed5da08) is on MusicBrainz.

Code: [analyze-low-level](https://github.com/ology/Music/blob/master/analyze-low-level)

As you can see, this is not the sexiest chart.  There are many many other libraries out there, but the one I chose was the simplest at the time.

Anyway, here are the rest of the tunes from my last release, "X", located on [my YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTS8kJCGNo_4d5x6POCTVw):

[Attenuation](radial/Attenuation.png),
[Beneath](radial/Beneath.png),
[Beyond](radial/Beyond.png),
[Clubster](radial/Clubster.png),
[Complexity](radial/Complexity.png),
[Composure](radial/Composure.png),
[Dignified](radial/Dignified.png),
[Dusk](radial/Dusk.png),
[Echolocation](radial/Echolocation.png),
[Emergent](radial/Emergent.png),
[Gondwana](radial/Gondwana.png),
[Lakeside](radial/Lakeside.png),
[Lush](radial/Lush.png),
[Magical](radial/Magical.png),
[Manifest](radial/Manifest.png),
[Ocean](radial/Ocean.png),
[Overlap](radial/Overlap.png),
[Puzzlement](radial/Puzzlement.png),
[Romantics](radial/Romantics.png),
[Serene](radial/Serene.png),
[Soliton](radial/Soliton.png),
[Sol](radial/Sol.png),
[Urgent](radial/Urgent.png),
[Vignette II](radial/Vignette-II.png),
[Voss Alteration](radial/Voss-Alteration.png)

As expected, my ambient tunes like Lush and Sol, etc. all have smaller fingerprints, because they all change the least in every way.
