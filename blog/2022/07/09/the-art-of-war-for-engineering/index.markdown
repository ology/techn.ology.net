Does [Sun Tzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu)'s venerable classic ["The Art of War"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War) apply to the discipline of engineering?  Who (or what) is "the enemy"?  And "spies"? Huh?  But there is wisdom to be had.

I suppose starting at the beginning is best...

The **state** is your company.  The **field** or **ground** would be either your development environment, or the whole development ecosystem in which you and your tools exist.

"The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors": **One** is "the moral law", which we will consider to be loyalty to your company. **Two** is "heaven" or time and environmental conditions. **Three** is "earth" which "comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death." Pretty heavy! **Four** is "the Commander" which "stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness." This is not just your CEO. This is virtue in you too. **Five** is "method and discipline" - something that makes sense to the engineer for sure! But for Sun Tzu, this is at a higher level - "proper subdivisions [and] graduations" in armies and ranks, infrastructure maintenance, and control of expenditure.

Must think for a bit before proceeding...
